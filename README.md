# Deepfake Defense: Constructing and Evaluating a Specialized Urdu Deepfake Audio Dataset

This repository contains the Urdu Deepfake Audio Dataset introduced in the ACL 2024 paper "Deepfake Defense: Constructing and Evaluating a Specialized Urdu Deepfake Audio Dataset".

The dataset focuses on two spoofing attacks â€“ Tacotron and VITS TTS â€“ and includes bonafide audio samples for comparison. The dataset construction ensures phonemic cover and balance, making it suitable for training deepfake detection models in Urdu.

### Dataset Statistics

The dataset includes the following four parts:

1. Bonafide Part 1
2. Bonafide Part 2
3. Tacotron
4. VITS TTS

The statistics for each part are as follows:

| **Metric**                   | **Bonafide Part 1** | **Bonafide Part 2** | **Tacotron** | **VITS TTS** |
|------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Total Duration (mins)**    | 1,302.66            | 1,271.65            | 1,061.96     | 1,340.79     |
| **Max Sample Length (mins)** | 112.42              | 120.75              | 80.34        | 111.01       |
| **Min Sample Length (mins)** | 61.73               | 56.45               | 44.64        | 65.53        |
| **Avg Sample Length (mins)** | 76.63               | 74.80               | 62.47        | 78.87        |
| **Files per Speaker**        | 708 audio files     | 495 audio files     | 495 audio files | 495 audio files |

## Structure

The dataset is organized into folders, each containing audio files for the respective parts mentioned above. Each folder is named according to its part (e.g., `Bonafide_Part1`, `Tacotron`, etc.).
